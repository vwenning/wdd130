    <p>My name is Victoria Wenning. I am getting my Professional Studies Degree. My certificates are all for
        graphic design. I love spending time with my family, dancing, and cooking. I am married and together we have 5 children, 0 grandchildren, but maybe someday if we are lucky.
        but we might have to wait on child #4 for grandbabies. I am taking this course because as I was looking at different
        graphic design jobs, many of them involved making websites for clients. I thought front end would suit me best.
